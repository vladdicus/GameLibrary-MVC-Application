# GameLibrary-MVC-Application
An MVC application created for SPC's ASP.NET Programming with C# course. The purpose of this project is to give users a platform to share and explore video game reviews in an organized and interactive way. Users will be able to submit new games to the library/database, write their own reviews, or browse through existing titles to see what others have said about games they may be interested in.

| 10 | Modeling | Create `Game` and `Review` entities | App can store games and allow users to leave reviews. | [ ] Games table created <br> [ ] Reviews table created <br> [ ] Relationship works | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshots as needed | Run migration; verify DB tables exist |
| 11 | Separation of Concerns / DI | Add `IGameService` to calculate average rating | Move logic out of controller into a service. | [ ] Service registered in DI <br> [ ] Controller uses constructor injection <br> [ ] Average rating returned correctly | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshots as needed | Call endpoint; verify average ratings display properly |
| 12 | CRUD | Add Create/Edit forms for games and reviews | Users can add or edit games, and optionally post reviews. | [ ] Form displays <br> [ ] Validation messages show <br> [ ] Changes save to DB | Implemented code; README write-up; screenshots as needed | Add new game, edit it, post review, confirm DB update |
